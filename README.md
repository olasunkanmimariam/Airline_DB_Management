# Airline_DB_Management

I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to implement airline management system projects. This project focuses on airlines, passengers, employees, location and flight sales etc.

* A relational database containing 5 tables was created [Flight, Employee, Location, Passenger, and Sales].

* As a result, I created relations between the tables using Primary and Foreign Key constraints

* Created a view that logically combined multiple tables using joins

* To demonstrate how to extract data from database for analysis, I prepared an example query with a subquery

* I Created DB diagram where all table relations are shown

### View Table

#### I created a VIEW, virtual table, whose contents are defined by a SQL query based on three-base tables.
